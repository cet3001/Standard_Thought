4. Keep these keys private; never commit them.

## Seed the Blog

Run `npm run seed:blog` to load the starter posts into your Supabase database.

## Start the Dev Server

Kick things off with `npm run dev`. When the server says it's ready, head to `http://localhost:8080/blog` and make sure the posts show up.

## Admin Manual Playbook Send

Admins must enter an email before hitting **Send Playbook** in the dashboard. The tool doesn't fire without a target inbox.

## Set up an admin in Supabase

1. Head to your Supabase project and open the `profiles` table.
2. Find the user and set their `role` column to `admin`.
3. Save it. The app picks up the change on next login.

That's itâ€”no more hardcoded emails.
