      question: "How do I start investing when I'm barely getting by?",
      answer: "Real talk—you can start building wealth with whatever you got, even if it's just $5. Here's how to level up financially from where you are:\n\n• Use apps like Acorns or Stash that invest your spare change automatically\n• Start with $1-5 weekly—every little bit counts when you're securing the bag\n• Choose low-cost index funds that don't require big minimums\n• If your job offers 401k matching, that's free money—take it\n• Learn the game through free resources before you invest bigger amounts\n\nThe key is starting the habit of investing consistently. Even $25 monthly builds wealth over time through compound interest.",

    {

      question: "How much money do I really need to start building generational wealth?",
      answer: "You can start building generational wealth with as little as $25-50 per month. Here's the real breakdown:\n\n• Start with whatever amount you can consistently invest\n• Build an emergency fund first ($500-1000 to start)\n• Automate small investments ($25-100 monthly)\n• Increase contributions as your income grows\n• Focus on high-yield savings and index funds first\n\nWealth building is about consistency over time, not how much you start with. Someone investing $50 monthly for 30 years can build serious wealth through the power of compound interest."

  const creditFAQs = [
    {
      question: "How do I build credit from absolutely nothing?",
      answer: "Building credit from scratch when the system feels rigged against you:\n\n• Get a secured credit card with a $200-500 deposit\n• Use it for small purchases you already make (gas, groceries)\n• Pay the full balance before the due date every single month\n• Keep your usage under 10% of your limit\n• Ask family if you can be an authorized user on their account\n• Report rent payments through services like RentTrack\n\nYou can see your credit score improve within 3-6 months with consistent payment behavior."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the fastest way to level up my credit score by 100 points?",
      answer: "To level up your credit score by 100 points, focus on these moves:\n\n• Pay down credit card balances to under 10% of your limits\n• Pay every bill on time for 6+ months straight\n• Dispute any errors on your credit report (check annualcreditreport.com)\n• Don't close old credit accounts (keep that credit history)\n• Consider a credit builder loan from a credit union\n• Ask for credit limit increases on cards you already have\n\nTypically takes 6-12 months for major improvements, but some people see 100+ point increases within this timeframe with aggressive debt paydown."
