        question: "What's the fastest way to build credit with no history?",
        answer: "Start with a secured credit card using $200-500 deposit, then layer these moves:\n\nâ€¢ Use the card for one recurring bill (Netflix, Spotify)\nâ€¢ Pay the full balance before the due date every month\nâ€¢ Keep usage under 10% of your credit limit\nâ€¢ Ask family with good credit to add you as authorized user\nâ€¢ Use Experian Boost to report rent/utility payments\n\nYou'll see your first credit score in 3-4 months with consistent behavior."

      {
        question: "How do I jump from no credit to 700+ score?",
        answer: "The 700+ credit score blueprint takes 12-18 months of consistent moves:\n\nâ€¢ Start with secured card, graduate to unsecured after 6 months\nâ€¢ Never miss a payment (35% of your score)\nâ€¢ Keep all balances under 10% of limits (30% of your score)\nâ€¢ Don't close old accounts once you get them\nâ€¢ Mix credit types: credit card + small personal loan\nâ€¢ Dispute any errors on your credit report quarterly\n\nMost people hit 700+ within 12-18 months following this exact system."

        question: "Can I really build wealth investing $5-25 per week?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Here's the math that shows why small consistent investing works:\n\nâ€¢ $25 weekly for 10 years = $13,000 invested\nâ€¢ With 8% average returns = $18,000+ total value\nâ€¢ $25 weekly for 20 years = $26,000 invested\nâ€¢ With 8% average returns = $63,000+ total value\n\nThe key is starting early and staying consistent. Use apps like Acorns or Stash to automate the process and invest in low-cost index funds."

      {
        question: "What's the best micro-investing strategy for beginners?",
