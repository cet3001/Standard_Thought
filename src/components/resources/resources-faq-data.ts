    question: "What if I'm broke?",
    answer: "Listen, being broke ain't permanent—it's just your starting point. We've all been there, counting change for gas money. Start with whatever you got: $5, $10, even loose change. Download apps like Acorns or Stash that round up your purchases and invest the spare change. Get a secured credit card with whatever deposit you can swing—even $25 builds credit. Hit up food banks, community resources, whatever keeps you fed while you're building. Your worth isn't your bank account, and your future doesn't have to look like your present. Every millionaire started with their first dollar."

    question: "Can I use this if my credit's shot?",
    answer: "Your credit score is just a number that can change—it's not a life sentence. I've seen people go from 400 to 750 in two years. Start with what you can control: dispute every error on your credit report (most people have them), become an authorized user on someone you trust's account, get a secured card and pay it off monthly. If collections are calling, negotiate payment plans or pay-for-delete agreements. Don't let shame keep you stuck. Bad credit usually comes from survival mode, medical bills, or life hitting hard—that's not a character flaw, that's the system. We're changing the game together."

    question: "How long before I see real results?",
    answer: "Real talk—this isn't lottery ticket thinking. Your credit score might jump 20-50 points in 2-3 months if you're consistent. Investment gains? That's a year-plus game, but compound interest is where generational wealth comes from. Side hustles can bring in $200-500 extra monthly within 30-60 days if you stay focused. The biggest change happens in your mindset first—you'll start seeing opportunities everywhere once you shift from survival mode to building mode. Progress isn't always visible, but consistency always pays. Trust the process even when you can't see it working yet."

    question: "Is this just another finance course?",
    answer: "Nah, this hits different. Most financial advice comes from people who never had to choose between groceries and gas, never had utilities shut off, never felt the weight of generational poverty. This is financial literacy from people who understand food deserts, predatory lending, and why 'just save money' advice feels insulting when you're already stretched thin. We talk about building wealth while navigating systemic barriers, family who might not understand your goals, and the mental load of breaking cycles. This is about financial freedom that acknowledges where you're really coming from and meets you there with respect."
